const arr = [2, 5, 6];  Here we can not change the whole array like arr = [3, 5,7] but we can modify individual element like arr[1] = 6; arr[2] = 9;

same goes for object const s1 = { name: "Moin", age: 25} s1 = {name:" tansen", age: 21}(not allowed) but s1.name = "Khan", s1.age = 28 ( allowed)


30_2 --> 

function add(num1 = 99, num2 = 0){
    const result = num1 + num2 ;
    console.log(num1, num2, result);
    return  result;
}
add(); here if you don't pass any argument it will set the default value into the parameter
like num1 = 99 and num2 = 0;


30_3 -->

here we will use (``) backtick instead of single '' of double quotes "" 
benefits of backtick ``:
I) multi-line strings
2) string interpolation ex:  console.log(`The sum of ${numbers[0]} and ${student.age} is ${numbers[0] + student.age}`); ${numbers[0]},  ${numbers[0] + student.age} these things are called string interpolation


30_4 -->

This is called function declaration
function add(a,b){
return a+b;
}

// function expression 
const add2 = function(a, b){
    return a + b;
}

// arrow function 
const add4 = (num1, num2, num3, num4) => num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;


30_5 -->

In arrow function if we have 1 parameter we can use () this bracket and this is not mandatory. 
ex: const getAge = (person) => person.age; or  const getThird = numbers => numbers[2];

for no parameter : const getPI = () => Math.PI 

// large arrow function. if you want to get anything returned from this function. then we have to use the return keyword ;
If we return something by writing return keyword then it is called explicit return and if some functions return something without explicitly writing return keyword then it is called implicit return 


30_6 -->

Spread operator (...) these dots are called spread operator. 
If we want to copy array element with passing the reference then we have to use spread operator
const friends1 = [2, 10, 20, 30];
//const dosto = [...friends1]; 
const dosto = [...friends1, 100] // here  100 will be added as an extra element .. we can do this also

const dosto1  = [friends1] here all elements well be added as an single element like this :
[ [2,10,20,30] ]
