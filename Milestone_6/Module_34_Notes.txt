Javascript is a highly abstracted programming language.

abstracted : উপরের লেভেলের বা উপরের দিকে উঠা ।

An abstraction is a way of :
i) hiding the implementation details
ii) showing only the functionality to the users

High Abstraction in JavaScript:
i) We don't have to handle resource management and memory allocation
ii) We don't have to handle garbage collection
iii) Reduces details so that developers can focus on logic better
iv) Improves understandability as well as maintainalbjlity of the code

**JavaScript collects garbage automatically**

**JavaScript is a JIT compiled language**

Just-In-Time (JIT)
i) JavaScript is not a purely interpreted language.
ii) Modern Javascript is JIT compiled
iii) JUST-IN-TIME compiler converts the entire code into machine code and execute them immediately.

js(file) -> parsing -> AST(Structured tree)->Compilation(JIT) -> Execution
   -> optimization -> Execution

**JavaScript is a multi-paradigm programming language**

paradigm: code structure that will determine the style or a way of programming 

1. procedural programming 2. Object Oriented Programming 3. Functional Programming

** JavaScript is a Proto-Typed based programming language **

** JavaScript is Dynamically typed **
